# LLM Tag Extraction

This repo uses __LLMs__ to __summarize__ and __translate__ articles posted on olympics.com, __extracs tags__ from the text, and then __justify the decision__ that lead to OpenAI exctracting that tag. These tasks are managed by a pipeline, which is built using __LangChain__, and the model is deployed on __Streamlit__ so users can interact with it. The __Streamlit app__ can be tested here: __https://tag-extraction-v3.streamlit.app/__
